Data Structure
The backbone of the pizza shop is the pizzaData array within the React component (PizzaList.js). This structured data serves as the foundation for each pizza, which is represented as a React component. This approach enables easy management and updates to the pizza information, ensuring a dynamic and engaging user experience.

React Skills
This project highlights fundamental React skills, including:

Props: Utilizing props to pass data from parent components (PizzaList) to child components (individual pizzas), enabling the dynamic display of information for each pizza.

Key: Implementing the use of keys to uniquely identify and track each dynamically rendered pizza component, optimizing React's rendering process and improving performance.

JSX: Embracing JSX syntax to seamlessly integrate JavaScript logic within the presentation layer, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

Displaying Data: Effectively leveraging React components to display and structure pizza data, creating a visually appealing and organized user interface.

Conditional Rendering: Employing conditional rendering to dynamically display information, such as indicating when a pizza is sold out. This enhances user experience by providing relevant and real-time information.
